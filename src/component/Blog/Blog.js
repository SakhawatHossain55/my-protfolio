          I was starting to follow w3school
          from the beginning. Spent the first second weeks in HTML. Was trying
          to learn the simple things of HTML. From the third week, I started
          HTML as well as CSS. Then in the third week I tried to learn HTML CSS
          well. In 2 months I learned simple things like HTML, CSS. Then I
          joined a programming-hero. Then I learned HTML CSS better at the
          beginning of the church. In the second week, I learned the simple
          things of html5 tag CSS3 bootstrap. In these two weeks creating three
          websites related to HTML CSS. Starting from the third week, JavaScript
          JavaScript sturdy time was about six to eight hours per day. At first,
          I didn't understand anything, but when I started practicing I started
          to understand little by little. Next week I will try to do the small
          things of JavaScript well. The intermediate level API started the
          following week. I am creating four websites with JavaScript API.
